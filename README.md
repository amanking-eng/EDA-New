Telco Customer Churn Analysis: EDA & Classification Models
Project Overview
In the commercial world, customers are king. Understanding the customer is of the utmost importance and understanding their behavior patterns can lead to very impactful business decisions. Customer Churn is the rate at which a commercial customer leaves the commercial business/platform and takes their money elsewhere, and understanding the underlying customer patterns will greatly impact a business' ability to retain their customers. As a data researcher trying to break into the professional world, I thought it would be pertinent to get a better understanding of what these churn data features may look like and how they can be used to understand the customer.

In this repository I will utilize a telecommunication company's (Telco) customer dataset to perform a very detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to develop a strong understanding of any patterns or trends existing in our data. Secondly, I will process the data and build a series of binary outcome classification models that will try to effectively predict whether a customer will or will not churn from the telecommunications platform.
